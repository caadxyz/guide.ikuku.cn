We believe the construction of emergency schools in the areas of Gorkha, Sindhupalchowk and Nuwakot to be a primary concern in the rehabilitation of Nepal. Not only have the earthquakes destroyed 90% of the school facilities but the mountainous landscape will make reconstruction very difficult. The project of an emergency school in the mountain area involves two main qualities: swiftness and sustainability.

The core principle of our architectural proposal is rapid construction. The system is designed in such a way that it can be transported by helicopter to the site in the mountain. This project requires five transport cases. The difficult location and vehicle accessibility of the valleys have dictated the design of the system, resulting in the use of a minimal amount of externally sourced materials. The assemblage can adapt to segment of different natures: big bamboos, trunks, and remaining structural elements from collapsed buildings. As a result, one would see a criss-crossed bamboo frame which can support a variety of building skins. The outer shell of the building will progress from temporary tarpaulin to permanent mud walls. The structure provides flexibility to maintain both the roof and walls during an earthquake.

The school is made of five areas: two classrooms, a lavatory, one covered and one outdoor courtyard. The treatment of the walls can be varied depending on the function of the space they enclose. Most importantly, this architectural concept allows for the quick and easy restructuring and addition of spaces. For instance, a covered courtyard could easily become a third classroom. The buildings respond to the terraced site, the size of the terrace, and the distance between each level. In this way, the system is very responsive to its surroundings, the possibility of future seismic activity and the changes this could bring about.

2015年04月25日14时11分在尼泊尔发生8.1级地震。同年05月12日15时05分在尼泊尔发生7.5级地震。数以万计的人们失去了自己的亲人。  

地震给尼泊尔人带来的不仅仅是一次性的对生命、财产、文化的伤害，还会带给他们许多长期的，甚至终生性的伤害。大量人员死亡切断了人们之间的社会关系网，让每个人都成为孤独的受害者。那些在地震中失去亲人的家庭，往往会承受长期的痛苦。无论是失去父母的小孩、失去老伴和儿女的老人、失去丈夫的妇女，孤独，思念，回忆会长期伴随着他们。 

以往常规的灾后重建都没能很好地为这类人群考虑。因此本方案利用尼泊尔家族聚居模式和传统的院落住宅空间，设计多个传统尺度的半开放小院宅，熟悉的人们共同居住在小院落中，形成一个亲密的小家族。而3到5个小院又会组成一个大院，形成一个社会化的大家庭。最终重建社会关系网络，来自不同家庭的失亲者相互帮助，相互安慰，相互扶持，共同迈向崭新的生活。 

The April 2015 Nepal earthquake killed more than 9,000 people, thousands of people lost their loved ones in tears.  The earthquake not only caused one-time damage, but also did long-term damage even permanent damage，especially for the families which lost their members. The parents who lost their children, the old who lost their son, the wife who lost their husband, these person can be chronically lonely and sad, even live a helplessness life.

The past regular disaster reconstruction projects have not managed to consider for this group of people. We, hence design several semi-open courtyards from traditional scale(smaller one) to relatively large scale. Smaller courtyards may compose bigger ones. 3to 5 families, which lost family members, or individuals could build up a new family. People who lost their beloved-ones from different families, help one another, and step into their new epoch of lives.

Although the design task is a temporary kindergarten, our design intention is to design a long lasting and sustainable building system that could contribute to the future of the earthquake affected area. It is an easily constructed system. However, it is easy constructibility should not be related to temporariness. Through a series of design approaches, the richness of the space should contribute to the pride of the community which in turn enrich the meaning of the architecture. In an expectable future, the architectural system could constantly serve the community, becoming a permanent structure.

Few measures that influenced our kindergarten design:

1.Easy accessibility of material

2.Easy constructing methods

3.Psychological needs of children and residence to get rid of the disaster

4.Children’s demand in playing facilities

The unexpectancy of the earthquake requires designs using easily accessible building material and constructing methods to promote voluntary construction by local residents and volunteers.  After researching on local conditions, we select bamboo as primary constructing material due to its easy accessibility, high strength and constructing methods which local Nepalese people are familiar with.

**GARS-GARSA2-Recycle, Religion & Rebirt**  
设计来源于对尼泊尔印度教的研究及其精神空间的转译。我们希望在给尼泊尔的受灾民众提供一个舒适的庇护场所的同时，在灾民等待家乡重建的过程中，能够借助宗教以及社区的力量来帮助他们获得心灵上的重生。

Our design comes from the study of Hinduism in Nepal and the translation of their spiritual space. We hope that we can offer not only a comfortable shelter for the disaster-stricken people, but also the mental rebirth in the process of the reconstruction of their homes.

通过将震后可利用的废弃物以及剩余人力资源集中起来，并提供简单的建造模式，让民众能够在志愿者的引导下参与自建工作。将废弃的砖石填入轮胎作为建筑的基础，不会破坏现有的场地的同时，起到隔震的作用。建筑的主体结构采用速生廉价的竹材，通过简单的捆扎和榫卯方式进行连接，从而降低建筑的自重及造价。竹材较强的力学性能也能保证余震后建筑内人员的安全。

By gathering the waste and human resources after the earthquake, we designed a self-building mode to help the local people to build their homes by themselves with the guidance of volunteers. The deserted masonry can be filled into tyres to create the bases of the building without the destruction of sites which is also helpful for preventing damages by  earthquake. The fast-growing and low-cost bamboo materials can be used as the main structure of the building to lower the weight and cost of it. Also, the excelllent stress tolerance of bamboo can cope with the aftershocks in the area, to ensure the safety of the people.

**The house as a water container,水容器的家**  
水容器的家 / The house as a water container  

尼泊爾有豐富的水資源，卻因為沒有好的存水設施，導致缺水狀況嚴重，所以企圖打造不只是災民的家，也是收集水的容器系統。

在發生天災過後，常會有大量運送的補給品物資，而裝補給品的收納箱是我們認為重要的組構單元，如果可以統一這些收納箱，我們就可以利用它來組構房子的牆體，每個收納箱就像一塊磚，堆疊起來就像是有厚度的牆體容器，它可以收集雨水再利用，所以當所有屋子的牆體容器都裝滿水，利用彼此間的聯繫，就可以形成一個可調節的水系統。

可調整的空間系統 / Adjustable space system

主要結構利用回收的鷹架來組構，鷹架是建造房子的臨時假設工程，鷹架因為需要可方便運送，所以開發出工業化的模具尺寸，也因組構時間快速，構築簡單，可以大量降低人力的組裝， 空間骨架中利用回收的鷹架來組構，讓當地民眾可以一同參與施工架低人力成本，也可因應當地需求調整空間關係，在開放系統的骨架中填塞容器，使內部牆體的容器成為收納空間，而外部空間成為水資源系統。利用當地的衣服布料作為最外層的皮層，讓每個家屋都可以有自我的面材，也可以利用布來調節濕氣與隔熱，讓屋子可擁有舒適氣候的環境。

**定日羊毛球幼儿园 [GARS-GARSA4]**  
“民族游戏将会是灾后儿童心中永不倒塌的支柱，
羊毛球幼儿园不仅仅是定日儿童提供活动场所，
更要成为他们生活新的喜悦与希望！”

“搜索羊毛球”是藏族儿童的一项充满探险精神的寻宝类游戏。孩子们中稍大的孩子会担任裁判一职，让其他孩子背过身去、闭上眼睛不能偷看，再把一个包着神秘奖品的羊毛球藏在一个难找的地方，然后大声宣布寻宝活动的开始，让孩子们开始放开手四处寻找。裁判在这个过程中会用淘气的暗示迷惑其他孩子，让他们被误导得在场地里跑来跑去，十分有趣。一旦有人发现了羊毛球，大家都会围上去激烈的争抢，将游戏推向高潮。

定日羊毛球幼儿园的设计灵感正是来源于这项传统藏族儿童游戏。临时幼儿园毛茸茸的外表，会唤起孩子们对羊毛球这项熟悉的游戏的联想；同时圆形的建筑外表，似宝珠、像飞船，又会激发孩子无穷的想象力。

尼泊尔8.1级强震共波及西藏19个县区,其中定日县是三大重灾县之一。全县逾万户房屋受损。

本案选址于白坝村的定日完小南侧空地。白坝村距定日县政府仅6公里，并且毗邻318国道，十分便于迅速集结救援团队和集散救援物资，适合做为定日灾后临时庇护和重建的基地。

构思来自于慕尼黑建材展上所见到的快速建造案例，在该案例中，用硬化泡沫塑料以乐高积木的拼接方式竖起中间空心的墙，往内灌入混凝土，硬化塑料部分充当了模板的同时也作为混凝土墙体的保温层。其时我思考这种建造模式，模板轻盈，易于拼接且不需拆卸，混凝土一般在2天左右即可硬化但需要近一个月才能达到设计强度。如果不用混凝土，在小体量单层的方案中，硬化泡沫塑料已经可以作为独立的结构墙体。在灾后重建中，硬化泡沫塑料易生产和运输，模数化的分割和乐高式的榫卯接口也易于当地居民手工建造，尤其是在灾后可能有余震的情况下，泡沫塑料即使倒塌也不会伤人，尤其适合幼儿园这样有特殊使用人群的类型。

方案将本来用于浇筑混凝土的空间尺度放大，置入功能。 并将墙进行错位，使空间大小异化以适应不同行为。以轻型钢拉结两片墙增加稳固性，同时作为地坪与屋顶的檩条。所有构件均模数化以尽量减少尺寸种类。考虑到当地盛产竹材，可用竹材代替钢筋，穿与泡沫塑料之内，增强竖向构件间的稳定性。

The conception come from the fast-building tecnique, which use the Expanding polystyrene rigid  foam board as the formwork of concreting, where esch element ensemble as  LEGO toy block. Then they pour concrete in the cavity while the Expanding polystyrene rigid  foam board act as the  insulation and needn't disassemble . The material is light ,easy to transport and build, especially when Aftershock happen it will not damage the users. So I design the nursery with the  Expanding polystyrene rigid  foam board as indepndent wall. With the junction like LEGO, it can be easily building by local people. Limited the hight and scale, it is study enough for being estructure.. I amplify the distance between two elemente and input function in where was concrete bedore. The distance can be varied to suit diferent activity. Steel bar is used as straining beam to enforce the relative stability. Also the bamboo cam be used  to connect the element by threading them together.

**Just a Minute**  

An earthquake can ruin the life of an entire community in a minute. This instant temporary home can give a new chance to start their life again in "just a minute" as well. "Just a Minute" aims to build a new life for nepalese people, giving them a simple but efficient house, very open to customization and future switching into a stable house. The main idea of the project is to use local Nepalese materials, or from close countries, to make a house that can be built quickly, lightweight and compact to transport, durable (despite it is temporary) and economic. 

The use of a deployable structure made of bamboo and textile building envelope, allows transport the house closed occupying a footprint of 2.5 x 4 meters and, once open, to get a 4 x 7.11 meters house. Its fabrication does not require complex technologies or skilled labor, but just a series of simple operations useful to prepare the various parts to be assembled all together. The modularity of the structure allows to organize the construction process in stages, as in an assembly line. For instance, the bamboo modules can be prepared by a team, a second team can prepare the central core, another can handle the textile envelope, and so on. Obviously, some parts can be prefabricated, so as to arrive on the fabrication site already pre-worked, speeding up the process.

At the center of the house there is a permanent part, made of coverable wooden OSB panels, equipped with all the services (bathroom and kitchen), which measures 1.5 x 4 meters. On the sides of the central block, are deployed the two main rooms (living area and sleeping area) which measure 4 x 4 meters, plus a small covered outdoor area of 1 x 4 meters. The two side rooms consist, in fact, of horizontal (floor), vertical (upright) and oblique (roof) bamboo poles with a diameter of 6 cm, braced by bamboo poles arranged in X, with a diameter of 3 cm. These poles are drilled at the center and at the ends, so as to allow the structure to unfold. The fixing of the poles, after opening the structure, is ensured by butterfly screws. This installation system requires few volunteers and a very simple process...

每一次灾难的降临，都伴随着辛酸苦辣，但带给我们的却是新的挑战和机遇，也是又一次的奋起和顽强，2015年4月25日，一声巨响打破了人们平静的生活，地震袭来了，面对突如其来的灾难，安置大量无家可归的难民成为了首要问题，在此基础上，我进行了灾中临时安置房的设计，此设计以乐高积木为原型，在此基础上进行结构改造，将其划分为不同的结构单元，并且与灾民的救援物资联系起来，提高了安置房的施工效率，同时保证救援物资与安置房的同时到达，确保灾民在最短时间得到安置。
 在建造材料的选取时，我选用了新型有机材料ABS合成树脂，也是工程塑料的一种，这种材料稳定性高，同时为轻质可回收材料，我通过将其加工成相同尺寸的模块单元，实现了生产过程的高效，同时在每个模块内甲保温层，保证了临时安置房的保温条件，模块最内部为空腔结构，用于填充各种不同的救援物资，如饮用水，衣物，通信设备，食品等，保证了救援物资与安置房的同时到达，在短时间内安置灾民，体现了作为设计师的人文关怀。

**Jigsaw Puzzle Shelter**  

Background

Among the past shelters, fast production and comfortable living condition couldn’t always be approached at the same time. Some shelters could be constructed in a short term and cost relatively little money, but the living condition inside the shelters was not satisfying. Refugees always complained about the problems that there was not enough space, every people in one family had to sleep in one single room; it was too dark inside the shelter, and there was always rain leaking from outside; the crying voice and noise of people losing there families coming from outside could be heard very clearly, which was not helpful for psychological rehabilitation; the smell from public toilet was too strong; there was too much mud and many insects inside the shelter; the aesthetic design of shelters had no connection with local culture that people could barely feel they were living at home. On the other hand, to construct a shelter for refugees with a good living condition would cost the government and organizations too much energetically and financially with a much longer time.

Meanwhile, the technology of CNC milling machine (laser cutter) and 3D printer has been developed extremely rapidly. These kinds of technologies make building and producing much faster and more popular, that almost everyone can make industrial products, even architectures by themselves.

Vernacular Architecture in Nepal

The traditional house in Nepal has the characteristics as follows:

1. The house has two sides slope roof. The materials that the building is made of are mainly wood and stone. Wood will be used as structure and stone will be use as walls and foundations.

2. The shape of the house is normally a straight simple volume. Sometimes local people will attach one or two more volumes to the main one to form an L or C shape...

**FLEXHOME - emergency shelter**  
FLEXHOME, is a folding modular home, of quick to assemble, lightweight and easy to transport useful in emergencies as a temporary home because it has a lightweight and foldable structure, which makes it stackable and easy to carry in large amounts and being able to lift refugee camps in minutes, since you only need 1 or 2 people to assemble the house in less than 10 minutes.

This house is inspired in tent camping and the mobile homes. FLEXHOME is a lightweight structure with wheels that allows it to be easily transported and assembled in minutes.

It consists of 75% fabric and 25% aluminum, polycarbonate and chipboard wood.

The house is designed based on fabric modules attached to aluminum frames allowing be folded horizontally pulling the sides, thus avoiding the use of any specialized machine.

The wheels allow isolating the house of the soil making the air circulate underneath avoiding moisture problems and possible diseases that may contain the ground.

The space is designed to function as a temporary home, but thanks to its modularity and flexibility can function as, hospital, school or other function, FLEXHOME also has the versatility of a mobile home but with the lightness of a tent camping, for what it can be transported or towed by an alone person in bicycle

The main concept of design is to retain the vernacular Architecture of hilly region in addition improving the structural soundness of building. People of rural area cannot  accept the completely overhauled design so proposal have focused on the traditional vernacular architecture. The traditional architecture also has qualities like creating comfortable living spaces.

**GARS-GARSA4 LOVE FLOWER**  
The sun on the national flag of Nepal looks like a blooming flower, full of hope, blessing homeland forever.  
尼泊尔国旗上的太阳亦如一朵绽放的希望之花，寄托了国家与日月长久共存的愿望。

In the meantime, the two overlapping triangles on the national flag of Nepal represent Himalayas, reminding people of the edelweiss, small and white, clean and bright, dancing freely.

国旗上两个重叠的三角象征喜马拉雅山，让人联想起无忧无虑、翩翩飘舞的雪绒花。

In both Buddhism and Hinduism, Lotus has its unique symbolic significance. Lotus touches something deep in the heart of the Oriental culture-peace, joy, delight, supernature and smile.

莲花无论是在佛教还是印度教，都有其独特的象征意义。莲花象征深入东方文化的骨髓，宁静、愉悦、超脱和微笑。

The design of "Love flower " is a combination of lotus, the sun and the edelweiss, with the management of modular containers to form a standard unit. The final shape of the Kindergarten is adjustable, according to scale and real use to form a ring pattern with 6, 8 or 10 standard units. The main concept is to provide a paradise for the kids in the disaster stricken area. Blossom of love flower may the kids bloom and grow, bloom and grow forever. And bless Nepal forever.

“爱之花”的形象，是莲花、太阳和雪绒花意象的融合，并巧妙用模数化的集装箱拼合成独立的标准单元。幼儿园最终的形态可根据规模大小和实际需求进行组合，形成6 瓣、8 瓣、10 瓣等的环状模式，为灾区儿童提供一处学习和游戏的乐园，希望他们尽快从灾难中挺过来。

**Chute to Shelter**  

我们的应急庇护所设计灵感来源于提高空投物资时投物伞的利用效率，将运输、结构、空间集合为一体，降落伞伞衣本身匹配充气结构，落地充气形成支撑及围护结构，成为应急庇护所空间。
空投物资包括其余必要组件和医疗、食品等物资。物资打包尺寸及重量均经过计算符合投物伞的空投能力。
设计中还提供了特色的雨水收集系统、多功能设备设施、集成化设计理念，提高了救援效率和灵活度，并使受灾民众具备一定的救援能力，同时降低了成本，节约了时间。

Design has transported, structure, space set as a whole together.Airdrop based.The parachute itself is matched with the inflatable structure, which is formed of supporting structure.The rest of the components including airdrop supplies and medical, food and other supplies.With characteristics of rainwater harvesting system, multifunctional equipments, integrated design concept to improve the rescue efficiency and flexibility, and reduces the cost,at the same time.
